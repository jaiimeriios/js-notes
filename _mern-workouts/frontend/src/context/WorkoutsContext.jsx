/*
    'Context' provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

    createContext:
    When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

    useReducer: 
    An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method
